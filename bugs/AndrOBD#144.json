    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I want to donate the project in the setting page, it shows \"No activity found to handle intent\"\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to settings\r\n2. Click support project (either paypal or bitcoin)\r\n3. Pops up an error message \"No activity found to handle intent\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I explained the reproduce steps clearly. So I made a bug gif as follows:\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83440203/116645357-40b2ed80-a9a8-11eb-8440-1c52d91189cf.gif)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA paypal or bitcoin donating page should be displayed.\r\n\r\n**Important details on your environment:**\r\n- Android OS version: Nexus 5X API 24\r\n- AndrOBD version: 2.0.7\r\n\r\n",

        "The link / intent ist supposed to start your bitcoin wallet app.\r\nYou will get this message only if you have NO bitcoin wallet installed on your device.\r\n",
        "Which means, that someone who would donate, can't donate it if they can't see the address.\r\nThe Bitcoin option should at least show the bitcoin address so users can see/copy what address to donate to... or else it's the only option if you have the wallet app installed.\r\nOr have a drop-down menu on Bitcoin option that displays the number or other options, like See number, copy number...\r\nOr Instead of nothing, show a text \"No Bitcoin Wallet installed\", so here's the Address: ... ... ... ...\r\nCurrently in my opinion this is not a good app behaviour.\r\n\r\n @imaryandokani does your app literary flash white like in GIF ?",
        "The thing is that this setting just plainly triggers a intent to open a URL (in this case a bitcoin://... URL)\r\nThis kind of intent does not have any specific error handling to be specified.\r\n\r\nWhat I did now is:\r\n- I added the plain text URL as descriptive text to these settings items, so it is at least readable from the settings.",
