    "title": "Can't use \"<\" and \">\" symbols in flashcards",
    "body": "###### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Add a new flashcard in an existing deck with \"<\" and/or \">\" symbols in it (whether it's on the front or the back doesn't matter). For instance, let's say we create a flashcard with \"Hello \\<name\\> on it.\r\n2. Save the flashcard\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Expected Result\r\n\r\nWhile studying or simply browsing decks, the flashcard should show the whole content (\"Hello \\<name\\>\" in our example from above).\r\n\r\n###### Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe text between the \"<\" and \">\" symbols and the symbols themselves are ignored. Only \"Hello\" is displayed in our example.\r\n\r\nAdditional information : if I create the flashcard in the Anki desktop app or Ankiweb and just sync it, it displays just fine on Ankidroid.\r\n\r\n###### Debug info\r\n\r\nAnkiDroid Version = 2.9.1\r\n\r\nAndroid Version = 7.0\r\n\r\nACRA UUID = 23c6ee72-7f20-4b10-a38c-8b73aa6f275a\r\n\r\n###### Research\r\n*Enter an [ x ] character to confirm the points below:*\r\n\r\n[ x ] I have read the [support page](https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html) and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid\r\n\r\n[ x ] I have checked the [manual](https://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/FAQ) and could not find a solution to my issue\r\n\r\n[ x ] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum\r\n\r\n",

You should update to 2.9.3 or (even better if possible) to the alpha versions following these guidelines: https://docs.ankidroid.org/#betaTesting\r\n\r\nThat will make sure you have the latest bugfixes so we know we aren't spending time diagnosing an already-fixed issue\r\n\r\nCan you please try the alphas (they are backwards-compatible right now, you can go back to stable if you need to) and let us know if it is still happening?",

        "@mikehardy I fear you're loosing your time. This is not a bug at all. That's the way ankidroid is expected to act. At least until fields shows interpreted html instead of plain text. That may not be good a good user interface, but that's how AnkiDroid is.\r\n\r\n@olhybrius You can use \"& l t ;\" and \"& g t ;\" instead of < and > respectively, and you'll see < and > in the reviewer. (Don't put the quotes. Don't put the spaces either. I put spaces here because github replaces \"& l t ;\" by \"<\" when there is no space) (lt means \"less than\" and gt means \"greater than\"). You can also use anki on browser if typing &lt; does not fit you.\r\nIf you have a note with an image or some formatting, take a look at it. Edit it. You'll see there is some < and > in the code. For example <i>some text in italic</i>. That's simply HTML. That's what Anki uses for formatting. In your example, you stated that:\r\n* after hello, I want to start formatting the remaining of the text in the way \"name\". Since there is no formatting called \"name\", it's simply ignored. \r\n ",

        "Good luck with finding any idea which does not require a lot of work. Adding this to ankidroid would mean incorporating an HTML editor and ensuring it interacts nicely with the backend. Nothing impossible, but we just need to find a dev' accepting to give days (at least) to code and debug it. ",
