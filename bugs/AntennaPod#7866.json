Go to \"Add podcast\"\n2. Tap \"Search fyyd\"\n3. Enter text to search for (e.g. \"Future Knowledge\" or \"Serious Trouble\")\n4. Press Enter\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expected AntennaPod to either display podcasts to pick from or say no results were found\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI get\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to create call adapter for class io.reactivex.Single\n    for method FyydService.searchPodcasts\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c3cf7a-78da-4248-a553-c5839c5cb150)\n\n### Logs\n\n[full-logs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21084257/full-logs.txt)\n\nEdit: fix autocorrected text",

        "I can reproduce this bug on:\n\n### App version\n3.8.0 (095f60da8)\n\n### Android version\n14\n\n### Device model\nShiftPhone 8.1\n\nHowever, I cannot reproduce it with a **development build** from the same commit on either emulators or a real device.\n\nTo reproduce it, a **release build** is needed; the error can then be reproduced on the emulator as well.\n\n## Possible solution\n\nThis seems to have to do with minification. I played around and the following proguard rules are the minimum I found to keep the classes whose removal produce the expetion:\n```\n# RxJava\n-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking class io.reactivex.Single\n\n# Fyyd\n-keep class de.mfietz.fyydlin.** { *; }\n```\n\nAs I am not an expert on proguard (and don't have the actual release keys), I would leave this up to @ByteHamster or someone with similar experience.",
