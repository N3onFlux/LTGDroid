    "title": "(KINDA CRITICAL) the bin doesn't work",
    "body": "In the latest version (v1.10.0), deleted notes don't go to the bin. I just lost all my notes testing it (I'm dumb and deleted them all + they weren't important)",
    "comments": [
        "Also newly created notes are duplicated to the bin, not being deleted from the main screen. It seems like the bin is now just a clone of the main notes storage.",
        "Thank you very much for reporting this. Silly mistake, I changed some code and used the wrong list of notes in the bin. So your deleted notes are not lost. I'm releasing a fix today."
