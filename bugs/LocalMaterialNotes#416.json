        "Thank you for reporting this and for making very detailed bug reports. In the future, when using pre-release versions, please make the bug reports directly in the corresponding [discussion](https://github.com/maelchiotti/LocalMaterialNotes/discussions/397), so this way issues are only about production (I'll close this one for this reason but I'll fix it before the release of course)."
