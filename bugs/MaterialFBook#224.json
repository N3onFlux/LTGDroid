        "That's correct, can't paste my password to log in - on tapping - and the displayed (Google) keyboard is hiding its Text Editing interface... It's there for the login (email, or phone #), but not for the password field.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Ah, it's completely b0rked, this version 4.0.2. I had just been muting people's stories and it throws me out back to the login - where I have to type the pwd again manually (bc of no paste) & this is too much of a pain to even test... Seems like some major malfunctions going on everywhere, heh. xD",
        "Nothing changed even with version 4.0.3. If I long-press while I'm writing something the app crashes.",

        "It has been doing this to me as well.. consistent crash on long press to paste.. for weeks now.. so I avoided pasting.   But just now when I just tried pasting something to confirm.. it worked.  Not sure what changed.\r\n\r\nPixel 3a, Android 10, patch level July 5, 2020, MaterialFBook 4.0.3\r\n\r\nThanks!",
