Open settings\n2. Enable \"scientific mode\" option\n3. Return to calculator\n4. Rotate device to landscape\n\n**Expected behavior**\nButtons should scale to accommodate the new screen orientation and not be cut off.\n\n**Screenshots/videos**\n\n\nExpected layout (setting disabled):\n\n![Screenshot_20250121-162132.png](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceec9242-f188-4aec-a57a-7e76e37c52fa)\n\n\n\nActual layout (setting enabled):\n\n![Screenshot_20250121-162159.png](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5ad4cc-69cc-4df3-bf61-c267de960862)\n\n\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\n - Device: Pixel 8 Pro\n - OS: Android 15 (AP4A.241205.013)\n - App version: 3.1.3, 3.1.0-beta1\n - Language: English\n\n**Additional context**\nApp data and cache were both cleared prior to testing, no other settings were modified.
