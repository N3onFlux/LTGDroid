        "@MisterAwesome23 The general way to go about fixing something like this is to first reproduce it on a device you have. Then get a stacktrace for it. Using this work out where the code is incorrect and attempt to change it so you no longer crash.",
        "What exactly is stack tracing. I performed the crash and noted the log cat for reason for crash that is from where I got the list view fragment function. Is there better ways to debug/stack trace or log cat is the right way.\r\nI am pretty new to debugging too, any idea how to grap onto debugging quickly, like any course or resources? ",
        "@MisterAwesome23 RE stacktracing yeah use you can use logcat. RE debugging its mostly something you just need to practise imo but there might be some good tutorials on Google.",

        "@ShridharGoel You can work on it. I think @MisterAwesome23 is not working on this.",
